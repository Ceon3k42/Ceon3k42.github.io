## Life on Ceon3k42
Ceon3k42 is the first planet other than Earth in the solar system known to have life. Scientists assume that there are multiple species of animals and plants on the planet, although they have only found 2 species of plants and animals, due to the limited time they have had to explore the planet

#### Animals
There are two known animals are the Volca Serpent, a large, snake like animal that lives in the lava pools, and the Chroma Pelted Driftbeast, a bear-like animal with striking fur colours. Read more about them [here](https://ceon3k42.github.io/life/animals.html).
