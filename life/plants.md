## Plant Life
Ceon3k42 is very abundant in plant life. The plants which have been seen are not in high varieties. There have been 2 main plant species - the Rubrum Crawlis and the Caeruli Formidulus

### The Rubrum Crawlis
Also known as the Red Crawler, the Rubrum Crawlis looks like a soft fern of sorts, in the colour red. It is a ground-cover plant. The plant itself is extremely difficult to break. It has stiff leaves, despite its resemblance to the soft fern. 

#### Taxonomy
The Rubrum Crawlis was named by NASA exploration team for its characteristic leaves and its abundancy as groundcover.

#### Botany
The grow to heights of 20cm. Each leaf can span up to one metre in diameter. There are no flowers or fruit present on the plant, therefore scientists came to the conclusion that they store seeds inside their leaves, or there are no seds at all.

#### Growth
Scientists are unsure of how long it takes for the Rubrum Crawlis to grow and develop. However, the soils have been measured to be extremely alkaline (16pH). There appear to be no water on the planet, so the plant thrives under dry, alkaline conditions.
