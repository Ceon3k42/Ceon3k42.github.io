## Animals of Ceon3k42
### Volca Serpent
A remarkable creature that thrives in the harshest of environments on the distant planet of Ceon3k42. 

#### Taxonomy
Volca is derived from "volcano," as it lives in and can withstand lava from Ceon3k42's volcanos. It also has some resemblance to a snake of Earth, thus NASA gave it the Serpent name.

#### Appearance
It's most striking feature is a scaly exoskeleton, with scales as tough as the volcanic rock that surrounds them. It is deep crimson, obsidian black and gold in colour. Each scale is arranged in overlapping patterns. It is 20m in length, and has bony crests around its eyes. Its nostrils and ears are covered with flappy skin.

#### Evolution
The exoskeleton and scales are assumed to have developed to provide a natural armor shielding the serpent from the intense heat and spewing lava flows. It's long and skinny body allows for effortless gliding through the treacherous terrain. Its crests protect its sensitive eyes from airborne volcanic debris, while its nostrils and ears are well-concealed to prevent ash and laval from infiltrating.

#### Habitat
The Volca Serpent lives within and around the lava pools in Ceon3k42. They can often be found bathing in the lava or resting on the ground.

### Chroma Pelted Driftbeast
A captivating and elusive creature that roams the wild, otherwordly landscapes of Ceon3k42. 

#### Taxonomy
In the English language, chroma means vibrant. It was given to the Driftbeast because of its multicoloured pelt and its highly saturated colours. The animal also moves along the foliage without damaging it very much, much like drifting on top of the Red Crawlers, despite its large size, thus scientists naming it Driftbeast.

#### Appearance
The Chroma Pelted Driftbeast has a coat of fur with many colours, like reds, greens, blues and purples. Its lush and multicolored fur is definitely it's most striking feature, which covers its robust, bear-like body. The fur is also thick and long. The creature's large expressive eyes are positioned atop a round, slightly domed head, providing an expansive field of vision. It's paws are equipped with retractable, razor-sharp claws.

#### Evolution
Its fur serves as its primary defense against the unforgiving elements of its unique habitat and creats a protective barrier that insulates the creature from the planet's extreme temperature fluctuations, relentless winds, and unpredictable storms. It's claws are for defense and efficient digging.

#### Habitat
It lives near the Blue Creepy Things. The plant's flowers attach themselves to the Driftbeast. The animal also digs holes in the ground as a form of shelter from the strong winds and temperature.
