Ceon3k42 is the first planet other than Earth in the solar system known to have life. There are at least 6 different species that have shown signs of interference with the planet's surface but only 2 have known appearances:

Volca Serpent: A remarkable creature that thrives in the harshest of environments on the distant planet of Ceon3k42. It's most striking feature is a scaly exoskeleton, with scales as tough as the volcanic rock that surrounds them. It glistens with a mesmerizing luster of deep crimson, obsidian black and molten gold. Each scale is meticulously arranged in overlapping patterns, providing a natural armor shielding the serpent from the intense heat and spewing lava flows of Ceon3k42. The creature's elongated body measuring up to 20ft in length, allowing for effortless gliding through the treacherous terrain. It's head it crowned witha  series of bony crests protecting its sensitive eyes from airborne volcanic debris, while its nostrils and ears are well-concealed to prevent ash and laval from infiltrating.

Chroma Pelted Driftbeast: A captivating and elusive creature that roams the wild, otherwordly landscapes of Ceon3k42. This astonishing beast has a vibrant and luxuriant coat of fur that not only dazzles the eye with its array of hues, but also serves as its primary defense against the unforgiving elements of its unique habitat. It's lush and multicolored fur is definitely it's most striking feature, which adorns its robust, bear-like body. Each strand of fur is incredibly thick and long, creating a protective barrier that insulates the creature from the planet's extreme temperature fluctuations, relentless winds, and unpredictable storms. The creature's large expressive eyes are positioned atop a round, slightly domed head, providing an expansive field of vision. It's paws are equipped with retractable, razor-sharp claws for defense and efficient digging, allowing it to uncover what lies beneath the rocky terrain.
