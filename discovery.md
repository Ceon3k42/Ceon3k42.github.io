## Discovery of Ceon3k42
Ceon3k42 was discovered when a very curious young child (unnamed) was looking through her father's telescope one night the August of 3042.

"I was looking through daddy's telescope, and a saw a really pretty, glowing, purple planet, so I took a photo with the telescope and showed dad," she says.

Her father, who works for NASA, showed the unknown celestal body to the rest of his team, the rest of his team claiming they did not know the planet. Five years later, they sent a spaceship in the direction of the planet. The team then set foot on the planet in 3070, and made the amazing discovery - there was life.
